# MCP Weather

**MCP Weather** is a project that connects to [weather.gov](https://www.weather.gov/) and allows users to query real-time weather alerts for any U.S. state using a two-letter state code. The system integrates with a Language Learning Model (LLM) using the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** to provide natural language responses and insights.

## Features

- 🔗 Connects to the official [weather.gov](https://www.weather.gov/) API.
- 🧠 Integrates with LLM via Model Context Protocol (MCP).
- 🗺️ Fetches weather alerts based on U.S. state codes (e.g., `CA`, `TX`, `NY`).
- 💬 Enables natural language querying and explanation of weather alerts.

## How It Works

1. **Connect to weather.gov** using its public alert API.
2. **Integrate with an LLM** via MCP to provide contextual weather information.
3. **Input a U.S. state code**, and the model fetches current weather alerts for that region.
4. **Receive contextual responses** from the LLM, powered by MCP.
